## Sales_Analysis_ETL_Visualization

# Project Summary

Project Overview:
This project demonstrates the complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, starting from data extraction via Kaggle API to advanced visual analytics in Power BI. The project emphasizes data transformation, SQL-based analysis, and interactive dashboard design.
Technologies Used:
â€¢	Data Extraction: Kaggle API
â€¢	Data Transformation: Python (pandas, zipfile, sqlalchemy)
â€¢	Database: SQL Server
â€¢	Visualization: Power BI (with DAX for calculations)

Project Phases:

1. Data Extraction & Transformation
â€¢	Extracted data from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
â€¢	Transformed the dataset in Jupyter Labs:
o	Renamed columns to lowercase and replaced spaces with underscores.
o	Derived new columns: discount, sales_price, and profit.
o	Converted order_date to datetime format.
o	Dropped unnecessary columns for optimization.
o	Saved the transformed dataset as a CSV file.

2. Data Loading
â€¢	Created a new database named Sales in SQL Server (not under the master database).
â€¢	Loaded the transformed CSV data into SQL Server.

3. Data Analysis in SQL Server
â€¢	Performed SQL queries for:
o	Top 10 highest revenue-generating products.
o	Top 5 highest-selling products in each region.
o	Month-over-month growth comparison for 2022 and 2023.
o	Highest sales month for each category.
o	Subcategory with the highest profit growth in 2023 compared to 2022.

4. Visualization in Power BI
â€¢	Imported the SQL data into Power BI using Import Mode.
â€¢	Developed interactive dashboards across four main pages:
o	Home Page: KPI metrics and sales trends.
o	Sales Analysis: Category, region, segment, and shipping mode analysis.
o	Orders Analysis: Order distribution across segments, regions, and top-selling products.
o	Profit Analysis: Profit distribution by category, region, segment, and shipping mode.
â€¢	Utilized DAX for custom calculations.
â€¢	Designed with slicers and filters for better insights.
